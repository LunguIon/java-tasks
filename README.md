2. Run tests to ensure everything works correctly:
   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```

## Pushing Your Changes to Remote Repository
Once you have completed the feature implementation, push your branch to the remote repository:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Added feature: <description>"
git push origin feature-<your-feature-name>
```
